# Snowden's Guardian Angels
An attempt to raise some funds and awareness at the same time

The Snowden's Guardian Angels are a bunch of guys, supporting Edward Snowden when he was hiding from authorities in Hong Kong, right after The Gurdian published the first few pieces of this phenomenal story. The NSA affair started rolling, and the world changed as it has never been before...

These guys, refugees themselves, had nothing - but gave everything they could to provide Snowden some shelter until he left Hong Kong later in 2013.

More details of the story are topic of media coverage from all over the world. 

Now, it was time to protect these Angels. The authorities tried to put intense pressure to those poor people. The campaign "For the refugees" was started to provide help and to find a new home for these people, where they find asylum, and could live a life free from any authorities pressure.

This project here was started right after the topic was raised once more by the lawyers of these people at the #34c3, the Chaos Computer Club annual congress #34. The talk is available at 

https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9297-the_snowden_refugees_under_surveillance_in_hong_kong

The idea is to provide ForTheRefugees with some funds, and awareness. 

How about having a community of computer users, each of them providing a little bit of the cpu power of his/her PC? Imagine, each of these users would provide only 10 Hashes per second, and would help mining Monero. This would sum up to a huge Hash-power, if only enoungh users are joining. Right now, 130,000 Hashes/second result in around 1 Monero per day. One Monero is about 300 USD at the moment...so 300 USD per day to help Snowden's Guardian Angels, and many enthusiastic users willing to share about their participation in Snowden's Guardian Angels-Support...

This is what I would like to start...now!

# Signed executables

All executables we provide are signed using a code-signing certificate, issued by an public Certificate Authority.

# Checksums

You could check the checksums of the provided files, just to make sure they are the ones we provide to you. The hashes are generated using sha256sum, and the files are signed by using gpg/pgp with the key belonging to pstimpel@googlemail.com. You can find the keys at https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=pstimpel%40googlemail.com&op=index, just make sure using the latest one!

The file containing the hash of the setup file:

[Hash of setup file](setuphash.txt)

The file containing the hashes of the files installed on your computer by the setup:

[List of hashes](hashes.txt)

You could verify the signature using your gpg/pgp installation, or by using online services such as https://keybase.io/verify. Once you verified the "list of hashes"-file itself is valid and signed by the key belonging to pstimpel@googlemail.com, you could check the installed files against the table of hashes using sha256sum.
