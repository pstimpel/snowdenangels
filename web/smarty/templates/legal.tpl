        <p><b>We have written this software to support <a class="marklink" href="https://fortherefugees.com/"

                keep any hashes or donations for us, we provide both the software and the webpage for free. </b></p>
        <p><b>XMR-stak is forked from the original project, and the fork does not claim 2 % of the hashrate for the
                developers, donation level is set to zero. The mining pools are claiming very few of the generated
                hashrate for them to run their infrastructure. For more details please visit their webpages. </b>

        <p>This webpage is using so called cookies, small data files storing kind of an identifier to recognize you

        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>This webpage does not collect any personal information except the ip address of its visitors. There are no
            services like Google Adwords, Google Adsense, Google Analytics active, not from Google or any other
            suppliers. If users enable "crash reporting" inside the software, we collect information about the crash,
            why it happens, the version of the software in use, and the ip address the crash report was sent from. If
            the user enabled sending stats to remote, we are collecting the hashrate, the period of time the software is active, an automatic generated machine
            key, and a user key. Both keys are random generated SHA-256 hashes.
            There is no chance for us the reverse these keys into something useful. The keys are only used to provide
            personal stats of the user, and are not displayed anywhere on our pages, except in the personal stats of the
            user.
        </p>
        <p>The buttons to share information in Twitter, Facebook or Google+ are passive, they do not transfer any
            information to these networks, except the user is using these buttons.</p>
        <p>The miner software sends data to the mining pool that was chosen by the user. Please refer to the pages of
            the
            mining pool in question to learn more about their privacy rules.
