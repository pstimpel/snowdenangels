# System requirements

You need to run your computer with Microsoft Windows Vista or later. dot-net Framework 4.6 has to be installed. The software in this package does not run on 32 bit operating systems. You need an Internet connection, and once the Software asks for permission to transfer data, you should allow this.

The software will open connections to the following webpages:

* redzoneaction.org, Stats- and Error-collector, if you give permission in the software to do so
* github.com, just to check for updates available
* one of the miningpools you select to work with, ports 3333 or 4444 are OK
* to "localhost", 127.0.0.1, to collect stats from the mining software itself


# Installation

Download the latest setup package and execute it on your computer.

# Updates

To update your installation, just download the latest setup-package, and run it on your computer. It will update all components. Make sure to close both the client application and the miner ("Stop Funding") before running the update!

# Is it safe to ignore the security warnings during installation?

We cannot answer this for you, and we are as foreign from your point of view as anybody else. However, all included components were checked with the latest AV scanners, and from our point of view they are no risk for you or your computer. Since this whole thing is about create fundings for Snowden's Guardian Angels, we saved the money to purchase expensive certificates just to sign our little piece of software. Sorry, if this invconvinient for you!
